# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering: software engineering is an engineering branch that is systemstic and disciplined dealing in the development,testing and use of softwares to solve real-life problems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? Software engineering is the branch that deals with systemic and disciplined development, testing and use of software to solve real-life problems. It is elated to traditional programming which is the conventional approach of writing codes to create specific instructions to be followed by a computer, but the two differ in key aspects as below:
1. Documentation and quality assurance: Software engineering places a strong emphasis on documentation, both for the code and the entire software development process with quality assurance processes, like testing and code reviews, being a vital part of software engineering where as traditional programming does not put much emphasis on the testing or the whole process itself.
2. Scale and Complexity: While software engineering deals with large-scale projects that are often more complex, traditioonal programming focuses on small-scale proects or single components within a large system. The former involves considerations such as scalability, maintainance, reliability, and security.
3. Process Orientation: Software engineering emphasizes a systematic and disciplined approach to software development whereas traditional programming may skip some of the stages and follow a less structred approach. The stages followed by the former are requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance which ae of less importance or ignored completely by the latter
4. TeamWork: Software engineering often involves collaboration among multiple team members where an exchange of ideas happen and deliberation with othes like software engineers, designers, testers, project managers, and stakeholders which is not the same with traditional programming which can be more solitary, with individuals working independently on coding duties.
5. Scope and Methodology: Traditional programming usually involves writing code to accomplish a specific task and/or solve a specific problem focusing more on coding and immediate problem-solving. Software engineering follows a broader approach involving systematic methods for the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. Software engineers often work with larger, more complex systems and follow formal methodologies like Agile.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
requirements engineering is the process of findig out what ais required of a software system before the building process starts.This is like the blueprint of building a software.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
